    "We aim to analyze the digital text (Financial Market News) to determine and find the review / emotional tone (reaction) / feedback of the audience who read the Financial Market News since the start of January'20 till the end of March'21. The review is mentioned in the 'Labels' column, having two categorical values, that is, '1' for positive review / reaction / feedback and '0' for negative review / reaction / feedback. It is importent to predict thefeedback of the news headlines as it determines the need of the customer, and chance to shape their sales and marketing plans, improve crisis management, and also look for improvement of their product to see what works and what doesn't. We are aiming to make a Sentiment Analysis model by using three different algorithms (that is, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine Classifier, and Random Forest Classifier). We also compared the accuracy of each model. By creating this model for the news, they can improve customer experience, optimize their services for their customer,and increase the positivity."
